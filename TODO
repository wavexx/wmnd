planned features:

	* wave++: use Texinfo for the documentation?
	* wave++: use X11 resources instead of wmndrc.
	* wave++: selectively include drivers by specifying the -D flag
	multiple times.
	* wave++: per-interface options (long names, etc)
	* wave++: per-display options (scroll speed, etc)
	* wave++: the driver subsystem really needs a rewrite to support
	these new concepts.
	* wave++: snmp driver could use a single session instance. I need
	per-driver termination handlers.
	* Jeff Greenfield: logarithmic graph scale.

completed since release 0.4.3:

	* wave++: the stats about the current speed twinkle too fast if
	a fast refresh is set. Make it independent and configurable.

completed since release 0.4.1:

	* Arthur Korn: rewrite the man page of wmnd

completed since release 0.4.0:

	* wave++: use autoconf/automake
